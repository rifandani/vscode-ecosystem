# Intro

<!-- TODO: add .gif after we finished all core features ![](../../res/region.gif) -->

[Folding and Region Folding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_folding) is supported built-in by the vscode, but we as a developer need to manually write the "region" as comments. Comment formats are different based on the programming languages. This module will make it easy to insert and see region marker comment in various programming languages.

## Commands

This extension contributes the following commands to the Command palette.

- `veco.region.mark`: Insert region marker comment (`ctrl+m ctrl+r`)
